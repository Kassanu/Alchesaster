  <summary>Mechanics</summary>
  
Everything will hurt the player. Being too close to explosions, being nears mines, standing in acid.  
Mixing more than 2 bottles will cause the cauldron to explode damaging the player.  
When all enemies are killed on a floor you can no longer cast spells, this prevents you from healing up on every floor.
